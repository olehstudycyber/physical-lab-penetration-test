# 🔓 LDAP Enumeration & Brute-Force Attempt – 192.168.1.2

This document records the LDAP reconnaissance and password attack attempts against the Windows Server 2025 machine running on the domain `narnia.com`.

## 🧪 LDAP Enumeration with `ldapsearch`

### 🔸 Attempts Made:
Several `ldapsearch` commands were run to enumerate domain information, including:
- Common mistake: used `-h` and `-p` options (deprecated)
- Correct method: use the `-H` option to define LDAP URI like:
  ```bash
  ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.1.2 -b namingContexts
🔹 Outcome:
LDAP service was reachable on port 389

Enumeration failed due to incorrect option usage

No domain naming contexts or user entries retrieved yet

🔐 Hydra LDAP Brute-Force Attempts
🔸 Tool:
Hydra v9.5

🔸 Commands Tried:
bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -L user_list.txt -P rockyou.txt ldap2://192.168.1.2
Then later:

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -L user_list.txt -P rockyou.txt ldap3://192.168.1.2
🔹 Errors Encountered:
user_list.txt was missing

Attempted LDAP3 simple authentication without providing -m (Bind DN)

Hydra requires -m "CN=User,...,DC=narnia,DC=com" to specify which DN to try logging into

✅ LDAP3 works with Hydra, but proper -m usage and correct user list are required for success.

🛠️ CrackMapExec & Impacket
crackmapexec (SMB):
bash
Copy
Edit
crackmapexec smb 192.168.1.2 -u user_list.txt -p password123
Result: SMB reachable, domain identified as narnia.com, OS: Windows 10.0 build 26100

❌ Connection failed: NetBIOS timeout — likely because username list was invalid or server filtering was applied

impacket-GetNPUsers:
bash
Copy
Edit
impacket-GetNPUsers narnia.com/ -no-pass -usersfile user_list.txt
❌ Failed due to missing user_list.txt file

✅ Lessons & Next Steps
✅ Use ldapsearch -x -H ldap://192.168.1.2 -b namingContexts to correctly enumerate base DNs

✅ Create a proper user_list.txt file with likely usernames

✅ For Hydra:

Use the -m option to define the DN path

Try:

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -L user_list.txt -P rockyou.txt ldap3://192.168.1.2 -m "cn=%u,dc=narnia,dc=com"
✅ Use GetNPUsers with a valid user list to look for ASREP roastable accounts
